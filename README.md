Project Title: NoteTaker - Java Web Application
Overview:

The NoteTaker Java Web Application is a simple and efficient tool for managing personal notes. It allows users to create, update, and delete notes, which are stored in a MySQL database. The application uses Hibernate for database interaction and JSP/Servlets to handle user interactions and requests. This project is a practical example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using modern Java web technologies.
Features:

    Add Note: Users can add new notes to the system, which will be saved in the MySQL database.
    View Notes: All notes will be displayed in a list format for the user to view.
    Update Note: Users can modify existing notes.
    Delete Note: Users can remove notes they no longer need.

Technologies Used:

    Java: Core language used for business logic.
    JSP (Java Server Pages): For rendering dynamic web pages and displaying data from the server.
    Servlets: For handling user requests and processing actions such as adding, updating, and deleting notes.
    Hibernate: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework used for database operations and to map Java objects to database tables.
    MySQL: Used as the relational database management system to store the notes data.
    HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.

Functional Flow:

    Home Page:
        The user is presented with a list of all notes stored in the database.
        There is an option to add a new note, edit existing notes, or delete a note.

    Add Note:
        A form is displayed where the user can enter the note's title and content.
        On submission, the form data is sent to the AddNoteServlet, which uses Hibernate to insert the note into the MySQL database.

    Edit Note:
        When a user chooses to edit a note, the EditNoteServlet retrieves the note by its ID and pre-fills a form with the existing title and content.
        The user can modify the fields and submit the changes.
        Hibernate is used to update the database with the new information.

    Delete Note:
        Users can delete a note by clicking the delete button next to it.
        The DeleteNoteServlet will handle the deletion of the note from the database using Hibernate.

Database Design:

    Table Name: notes
        id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
        title (VARCHAR)
        content (TEXT)
        date (TIMESTAMP)

Servlets Overview:

    AddNoteServlet:
        Handles the creation of new notes.
        Receives note details from the JSP form and stores them in the database using Hibernate.

    EditNoteServlet:
        Fetches the note details for editing and updates the record in the database after modifications.

    DeleteNoteServlet:
        Handles the deletion of notes by removing the specified record from the database.

    ListNotesServlet:
        Fetches all the notes from the database and displays them on the home page.

Hibernate Configuration:

    Hibernate Configuration File (hibernate.cfg.xml): Contains configuration details such as the database connection URL, username, password, and dialect for MySQL.
    Entity Class (Note.java): Represents the Note entity that maps to the notes table in the database.
    SessionFactory: Used to obtain sessions for performing database transactions (CRUD operations).

JSP Pages:

    home.jsp:
        Displays a list of all notes.
        Includes buttons for adding, editing, and deleting notes.

    add_note.jsp:
        A form for creating new notes with fields for title and content.

    edit_note.jsp:
        Pre-populated form with the selected note's details for editing.

Workflow:

    Add Note:
        User clicks "Add Note" -> Redirected to add_note.jsp -> Submits the form -> AddNoteServlet processes the request -> Note is saved in the database.

    Edit Note:
        User clicks "Edit" next to a note -> Redirected to edit_note.jsp with pre-filled data -> Submits the form -> EditNoteServlet processes the request -> Note is updated in the database.

    Delete Note:
        User clicks "Delete" next to a note -> DeleteNoteServlet processes the deletion -> Note is removed from the database.

Deployment:

The application can be deployed on any servlet-compatible server such as Apache Tomcat. Configuration for MySQL and Hibernate needs to be correctly set up before deployment.
Future Enhancements:

    User authentication to secure the application.
    Categorization of notes.
    Search functionality for notes.
    Pagination for long lists of notes.

This project demonstrates the integration of Java Servlets, JSP, Hibernate, and MySQL in creating a full-featured web application capable of performing CRUD operations.
